  { name: "Alzheimer's Disease", pct: '60–80%', desc: "The most common cause of dementia. Characterized by plaques and tangles in the brain that damage nerve cells. Typically begins with memory loss and progresses to language, problem-solving, and eventually physical difficulties.", symptoms: ["Progressive memory loss", "Confusion about time and place", "Language and communication difficulties", "Behavioral and personality changes"] },
  { name: 'Vascular Dementia', pct: '10%', desc: 'Caused by conditions that block or reduce blood flow to the brain, often following a stroke. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected.', symptoms: ["Sudden changes after a stroke or series of mini-strokes", "Problems with planning, organizing, judgment", "Memory loss", "Slowed thinking"] },
  { name: 'Lewy Body Dementia', pct: '~10%', desc: 'Caused by abnormal protein deposits (Lewy bodies) in the brain. Includes both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson\'s disease dementia.', symptoms: ["Visual hallucinations early in the disease", "Movement problems similar to Parkinson's", "Sleep disturbances (acting out dreams)", "Significant fluctuations in alertness"] },
  { name: 'Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)', pct: '5–10%', desc: 'Affects the frontal and temporal lobes. More common in people under 65. Affects behavior, personality, and language more than memory in the early stages.', symptoms: ["Dramatic personality changes", "Inappropriate social behavior", "Language difficulties", "Lack of empathy or insight"] },
  { name: "Parkinson's Disease Dementia", pct: 'Varies', desc: "Develops in people who have had Parkinson's disease. Not everyone with Parkinson's develops dementia, but the risk increases significantly over time.", symptoms: ["Thinking and memory problems", "Visual hallucinations", "Movement difficulties (tremor, rigidity)", "Sleep problems"] },
  { name: 'Mixed Dementia', pct: 'Common', desc: "More than one type of dementia occurs simultaneously, most often Alzheimer's combined with vascular dementia. Researchers believe mixed dementia may be more common than previously recognized.", symptoms: ["Combination of symptoms from multiple types", "Often diagnosed after age 80", "Accelerated decline"] },
  { name: 'Early-Onset Dementia', pct: '~5%', desc: 'Any type of dementia diagnosed under age 65. More likely to be genetic (early-onset Alzheimer\'s) or FTD. Unique challenges around employment, younger families, and insurance.', symptoms: ["Same as the underlying type", "Often misdiagnosed initially", "Special considerations for younger adults"] },
